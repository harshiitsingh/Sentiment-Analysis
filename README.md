# Sentiment-analysis

This project is based on <b><u>Natural Language Processing</u></b>, which predicts a text whether it is Positive, Negative or Neutral. It also includes a user feedback system which will be stored in the databse.

Special thanks to [Saurav Pati](https://github.com/oyesaurav) who helped me in the integration of ML model with the Webpage by making a React and Express server.


Here is the snapshot of the webpage:
